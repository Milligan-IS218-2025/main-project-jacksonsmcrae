            My name is Jackson McRae. I am from Lebanon, TN which is about 4 hours from Milligan. What was really cool about me coming to Milligan was that my Mom grew up in Johnson City. She went
            to Science Hill and she graduated from ETSU. I have loved being in Johnson City because of the difference in scenery as compared to where I am from. It is really flat where I am so driving
            around JC and being able to see the mountains and sunsets is a nice change. I also like the weather up here a lot better as well. It is super humid and hot where I am from, which is not a
            big difference from here but still better than Lebanon.

            At Milligan, I am currently double Majoring in Computer Science and Cybersecurity. I started out in Mechanical Engineering to give it a try, but quickly wanted to switch to CS and Cyber 
            because that is what I have wanted to do for a lot longer than ME. So far I have really enjoyed these two majors and they have helped me to learn a lot and contiune my passion for computers.
            I have also had the privilege to get my first internship with the IT Department for Blackburn, Childers, and Steagall. Through this internship, I have been able to expand my knowledge in
            my degrees, but also work on other skills like communication and teamwork. These come into play, especially in IT, because we are constantly working with the employees of the firm
            and helping them to fix their issues. Being able to work with the other IT members and communicate to the employees effectively and efficiently is crucial to my everyday work.

            The website I am creating is going to be an informational source for bowling balls. Bowling has been a part of my life since Freshman year of highschool. I went out on a limb and tried out
            for the team. When I made it, I did not realize how deep I would get into it. It quickly became a priority and found myself bowling almost daily and competing around the state. This lead to 
            me meeting the Head Coach, Brian Rickert, for Milligan's Bowling Team. He gave me the opportunity to continue my athletic career into college. Bowling is a very extensive sport and a lot 
            goes into being the best you can be. With this, bowling balls play a huge part and it is important to know how different bowling balls can affect you and the lane, and when you should or 
            should not use one.
